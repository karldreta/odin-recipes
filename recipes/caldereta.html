                    <li>In a large pot, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Saut√© the onions and garlic until aromatic and translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add the beef cubes and brown them on all sides. This adds depth of flavor to the stew.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the tomato sauce, liver spread, and beef broth. Stir well to combine.</li>
                    <li>Add the bay leaf, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer until the beef is tender (this may take about 1.5 to 2 hours).</li>
                    <li>Add the potatoes, carrots, red and green bell peppers, and green olives. Continue simmering until the vegetables are cooked and the sauce has thickened.</li>

                    <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning according to your preference. You can add more salt, pepper, or even a bit of sugar to balance the flavors.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with fresh parsley or green onions. If you like it spicy, you can add chili peppers. Serve the caldereta hot over steamed rice.</li>
